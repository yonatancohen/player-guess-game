# PlayerGuessGame

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Building

To build the project for production run:

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.


```bash
serve -s dist/player-guess-game/browser -l 4200
```

This will create a server so you can check the production version


Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
